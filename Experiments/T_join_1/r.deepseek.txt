Here's the most efficient SQL query to push down to PostgreSQL, combining all transformation steps into a single query:

```sql
SELECT o.*, c.*
FROM "public".orders o
JOIN "public".customer c ON o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
WHERE c.c_nationkey = 10
ORDER BY o.o_custkey, c.c_custkey;
```

To optimize execution, create these indexes if they don't exist:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_customer_custkey_nationkey ON "public".customer(c_custkey, c_nationkey);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_custkey ON "public".orders(o_custkey);
```
