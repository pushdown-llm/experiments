Of course. I can provide you with an optimized SQL query that pushes the transformation logic down to the PostgreSQL database.

Here is a ready-to-execute code snippet that includes the necessary optimizations and the final query.

```
-- SQL Query for ETL Pushdown and Optimization

-- Step 1: Create indexes to optimize the join and filter operations.
-- This index speeds up filtering on the customer's nation.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_customer_nationkey ON public.customer (c_nationkey);

-- This index speeds up the join operation on the customer key.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_customer_custkey ON public.customer (c_custkey);

-- This index speeds up the join operation on the order's customer key.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_custkey ON public.orders (o_custkey);


-- Step 2: Execute the consolidated and optimized query.
-- This single query performs the join and filter operations directly in the database.
SELECT
    -- Columns from the 'orders' table
    o.o_orderkey,
    o.o_custkey,
    o.o_orderstatus,
    o.o_totalprice,
    o.o_orderdate,
    o.o_orderpriority,
    o.o_clerk,
    o.o_shippriority,
    o.o_comment AS o_comment,

    -- Columns from the 'customer' table
    c.c_custkey,
    c.c_name,
    c.c_address,
    c.c_nationkey,
    c.c_phone,
    c.c_acctbal,
    c.c_mktsegment,
    c.c_comment AS c_comment
FROM
    public.orders AS o
INNER JOIN
    public.customer AS c ON o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
WHERE
    c.c_nationkey = 10;
```

I have provided the SQL to create indexes which will significantly speed up query execution. The final SELECT statement combines all the transformation steps into a single query for the database to execute efficiently.
