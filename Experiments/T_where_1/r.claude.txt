Looking at this ETL transformation, it reads from the orders table, filters for records where o_orderpriority equals '3-MEDIUM', and outputs to a text file.
Here's the optimized SQL query that can be pushed down to PostgreSQL:

```
-- Create index for optimization
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_orderpriority ON public.orders(o_orderpriority);

-- Main query with pushdown filter
SELECT
  o_orderkey,
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus,
  o_totalprice,
  o_orderdate,
  o_orderpriThe index on o_orderpriority will dramatically improve query performance by allowing PostgreSQL to quickly locate matching records instead of scanning the entire table.
