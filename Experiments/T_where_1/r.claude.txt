Looking at this ETL transformation, I can see it's extracting data from the `orders` table and filtering for records where `o_orderpriority` equals `'3-MEDIUM'`.

Here's the SQL query that can be pushed down to the Postgres database:

```
-- Main query with filter pushed down to database
SELECT
  o_orderkey,
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus,
  o_totalprice,
  o_orderdate,
  o_orderpriority,
  o_clerk,
  o_shippriority,
  o_comment
FROM "public".orders
WHERE o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM';

-- Index optimization for query performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_orderpriority 
ON "public".orders (o_orderpriority);

-- Alternative composite index if you frequently filter by priority and need other columns
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_priority_orderkey 
ON "public".orders (o_orderpriority, o_orderkey);

-- Query plan analysis (run to verify index usage)
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT o_orderkey, o_custkey, o_orderstatus, o_totalprice, o_orderdate, 
       o_orderpriority, o_clerk, o_shippriority, o_comment
FROM "public".orders
WHERE o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM';
```

The key optimizations:

1. **Filter pushdown**: The `WHERE o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM'` clause is moved to the database level, reducing data transfer
2. **Index on filter column**: Creates an index on `o_orderpriority` to speed up the WHERE clause
3. **CONCURRENTLY option**: Allows index creation without blocking table access
4. **Query plan verification**: Use EXPLAIN to confirm the index is being used

The original ETL was doing a full table scan then filtering in the ETL tool. This optimized approach filters at the database level, transferring only the needed rows.
