Of course. Here is the SQL query that pushes the transformation logic down to the database, along with the necessary optimization code.

```
-- SQL Query Pushdown
-- This query combines the data selection and filtering steps into a single operation executed directly by the database.
SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    o_totalprice,
    o_orderdate,
    o_orderpriority,
    o_clerk,
    o_shippriority,
    o_comment
FROM
    "public".orders
WHERE
    o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM      ';

-- Query Optimization
-- Creating an index on the filtered column allows the database to locate the required data much faster, avoiding a full table scan.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_orderpriority ON "public".orders (o_orderpriority);
```

I have provided the combined SELECT query that performs the filtering directly in the database and a CREATE INDEX statement to ensure the query executes efficiently.
