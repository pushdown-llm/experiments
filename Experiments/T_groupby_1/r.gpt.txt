```sql
-- Pushdown SQL for PostgreSQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_orders_grouped_sorted AS
SELECT 
  o_orderpriority,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM 
  public.orders
GROUP BY 
  o_orderpriority
ORDER BY 
  o_orderpriority;

-- Create index to speed up ORDER BY
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_orders_grouped_sorted_orderpriority
ON mv_orders_grouped_sorted (o_orderpriority);
```

Explanation: This query groups and sorts directly in the source and materializes it for fast export.
