Looking at this ETL transformation, it reads from the orders table, sorts by order priority, then groups by order priority to count orders.

Here's the optimized SQL query that pushes down the entire transformation:

```
-- Main query with pushdown optimization
SELECT 
    o_orderpriority,
    COUNT(o_orderkey) AS count_o_orderkey
FROM "public".orders
GROUP BY o_orderpriority
ORDER BY o_orderpriority;

-- Optimization: Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_orderpriority 
ON "public".orders (o_orderpriority);

-- Optional: Update table statistics for better query planning
ANALYZE "public".orders;
```

The SQL query eliminates the intermediate sort step since PostgreSQL can optimize GROUP BY with ORDER BY, and the index on o_orderpriority will speed up both grouping and sorting operations.
