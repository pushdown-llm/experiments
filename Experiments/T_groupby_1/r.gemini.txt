Of course. I can provide an optimized SQL query that replicates the logic from your ETL transformation.

This document contains the SQL code to create an index for optimization and the final query to be executed against your PostgreSQL database.

```
-- Optimization: Create an index on the grouping column to accelerate data retrieval and sorting.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_orderpriority ON public.orders (o_orderpriority);

-- ETL Pushdown Query: This query groups by order priority and counts the orders for each priority, pushing the entire transformation down to the database.
SELECT
  o_orderpriority,
  COUNT(o_orderkey) AS "Count"
FROM
  public.orders
GROUP BY
  o_orderpriority
ORDER BY
  o_orderpriority;
```

I have provided a single SQL query that performs the grouping and aggregation, along with a CREATE INDEX statement to ensure the query executes efficiently on the server.
