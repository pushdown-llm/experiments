Here's the most efficient SQL query to push down to PostgreSQL, combining all transformations into a single query:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS orders_priority_count AS
SELECT 
    o_orderpriority,
    COUNT(o_orderkey) AS order_count
FROM 
    public.orders
GROUP BY 
    o_orderpriority
ORDER BY 
    o_orderpriority ASC;

-- To refresh the materialized view when needed:
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW orders_priority_count;
```

This query combines the table input, sorting, and grouping operations into a single efficient materialized view that can be queried directly. The materialized view will persist the results for faster subsequent access.
