Of course. Here is the SQL query that corresponds to the ETL transformation, which finds the top three customers by total order value for each nation.

To optimize the query's execution, creating indexes on the foreign key columns used in the joins will significantly speed up performance.

```
/*
 This query consolidates the ETL steps into a single database operation.
 It joins customer, orders, and nation tables, calculates the total sum of
 prices for each customer, and then uses a window function to rank customers
 within each nation to find the top 3.
*/
WITH ranked_customers AS (
  SELECT
    c.c_custkey,
    n.n_name,
    SUM(o.o_totalprice) AS total_price,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY n.n_name ORDER BY SUM(o.o_totalprice) DESC) AS customer_position
  FROM
    public.orders AS o
    JOIN public.customer AS c ON o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
    JOIN public.nation AS n ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey
  GROUP BY
    n.n_name,
    c.c_custkey
)
