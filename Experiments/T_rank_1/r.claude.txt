Looking at this ETL transformation, I can see it's finding the top 3 customers by total order value within each nation. Here's the optimized SQL query:

```
-- Create indexes for optimal performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_custkey ON public.orders(o_custkey);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_customer_custkey ON public.customer(c_custkey);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_customer_nationkey ON public.customer(c_nationkey);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_nation_nationkey ON public.nation(n_nationkey);

-- Main query: Top 3 customers by total order value per nation
WITH customer_totals AS (
    SELECT 
        c.c_nationkey,
        o.o_custkey,
        SUM(o.o_totalprice) as total_price
    FROM public.orders o
    INNER JOIN public.customer c ON o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
    GROUP BY c.c_nationkey, o.o_custkey
),
ranked_customers AS (
    SELECT 
        c_nationkey,
        o_custkey,
        total_price,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY c_nationkey ORDER BY total_price DESC) as customer_position
    FROM customer_totals
)
SELECT 
    n.n_name,
    rc.customer_position,
    rc.o_custkey,
    rc.total_price
FROM ranked_customers rc
INNER JOIN public.nation n ON rc.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey
WHERE rc.customer_position <= 3
ORDER BY rc.c_nationkey, rc.customer_position;
```

This SQL query replaces the complex ETL transformation with a single optimized query that uses window functions for ranking. The indexes on join columns will significantly speed up the joins and grouping operations by enabling index-based lookups instead of full table scans.
