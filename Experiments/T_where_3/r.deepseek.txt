Here's the most efficient SQL query to push down to PostgreSQL, along with an optimization index:

```sql
-- Create an index to speed up the LIKE filter on o_orderpriority
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_orderpriority_low ON orders (o_orderpriority) 
WHERE o_orderpriority LIKE '%LOW%';

-- Pushdown query to execute on PostgreSQL
SELECT 
  o_orderkey,
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus,
  o_totalprice,
  o_orderdate,
  o_orderpriority,
  o_clerk,
  o_shippriority,
  o_comment
FROM orders
WHERE o_orderpriority LIKE '%LOW%';
```

The index is optimized for the specific filter condition and will significantly speed up query execution.
