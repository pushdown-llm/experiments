Based on the ETL transformation, here's the optimized SQL query that pushes down the filtering to the data source:

```
-- Create index for optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_orderpriority_like 
ON public.orders USING btree (o_orderpriority text_pattern_ops)
WHERE o_orderpriority LIKE '%LOW%';

-- Optimized query with pushed-down filter
SELECT 
    o_orderkey,
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    o_totalprice,
    o_orderdate,
    o_orderpriority,
    o_clerk,
    o_shippriority,
    o_comment
FROM public.orders
WHERE o_orderpriority LIKE '%LOW%';
```

The query pushes the LIKE filter directly to PostgreSQL, eliminating the need to transfer all rows for client-side filtering. The partial index with text_pattern_ops operator class optimizes LIKE operations containing the 'LOW' substring pattern.
