Here's the most efficient SQL query to push down to PostgreSQL, along with optimization code:

```sql
-- Main query with date range filter pushed down
SELECT 
  o_orderkey,
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus,
  o_totalprice,
  o_orderdate,
  o_orderpriority,
  o_clerk,
  o_shippriority,
  o_comment
FROM "public".orders
WHERE o_orderdate BETWEEN '1997-01-01' AND '1997-12-31';

-- Optimization: Create an index on o_orderdate if it doesn't exist
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_orderdate ON "public".orders(o_orderdate);
```

The query filters data at source and the index speeds up date range filtering.
