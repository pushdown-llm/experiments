Looking at this ETL transformation, it reads from the orders table and filters rows where o_orderdate is within the year 1997.Optimized SQL Query with IndexCode

```
-- Create index for optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_orderdate ON public.orders (o_orderdate);

-- Main query that replaces the ETL transformation
SELECT
  o_orderkey,
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus,
  o_totalprice,
  o_orderdate,
  o_orderpriority,
  o_clerk,
  o_shippriority,
  o_comment
FROM public.orders
WHERE o_orderdate >= '1997-01-01'::date 
  AND o_orderdate < '1998-01-01'::date;
```
  
The index on o_orderdate enables efficient range scans for the date filter, and using < '1998-01-01' instead of <= '1997-12-31 23:59:59' avoids timestamp precision issues while maintaining the same logic.
