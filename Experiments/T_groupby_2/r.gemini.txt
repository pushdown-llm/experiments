Of course. Here is the SQL query that pushes the transformation logic down to the database, along with the necessary optimization code.

This single query performs the grouping and aggregation directly in the database, which is significantly more efficient than processing it in an external tool.

```
/* This query pushes the entire transformation logic down to the PostgreSQL database.
  It groups by customer and order status, calculates the sum of the total price for each group,
  and orders the results as specified in the ETL process.
*/
SELECT
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    SUM(o_totalprice) AS "Total price"
FROM
    "public".orders
GROUP BY
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus
ORDER BY
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus;

/*
  This optimization creates a composite index on the columns used for grouping and sorting.
  This index allows PostgreSQL to find and process the required data much faster,
  avoiding a full table scan and an explicit sort operation.
  The IF NOT EXISTS clause prevents an error if the index already exists.
*/
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_custkey_status 
ON "public".orders (o_custkey, o_orderstatus);
```

I have provided the SQL query that replicates your ETL logic and an accompanying CREATE INDEX statement to ensure its efficient execution on the PostgreSQL database.
