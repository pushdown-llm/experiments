```sql
-- Pushed-down query with sorting and aggregation in PostgreSQL
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_orders_grouped AS
SELECT
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus,
  SUM(o_totalprice) AS total_price
FROM
  public.orders
GROUP BY
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus
ORDER BY
  o_custkey ASC,
  o_orderstatus ASC;

-- Optimization: create index to speed up refresh and query
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_orders_grouped ON mv_orders_grouped (o_custkey, o_orderstatus);
```

**Explanation:** This pushes the full sort and group by to the database and creates a materialized view with an index for faster reads.
