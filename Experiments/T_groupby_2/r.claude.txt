Looking at this ETL transformation, it reads from the orders table, sorts by customer key and order status, then groups by those same fields while summing the total price.

```
-- Create composite index for optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_custkey_orderstatus ON public.orders (o_custkey, o_orderstatus);

-- Main query that replaces the ETL transformation
SELECT 
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    SUM(o_totalprice) AS "Total price"
FROM public.orders
GROUP BY o_custkey, o_orderstatus
ORDER BY o_custkey, o_orderstatus;
```

The composite index on (o_custkey, o_orderstatus) eliminates the need for explicit sorting since PostgreSQL can use the index for both grouping and ordering operations in a single pass.
