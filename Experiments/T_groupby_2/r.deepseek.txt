Here's the most efficient SQL query to push down to PostgreSQL, combining all transformation steps into a single query:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE grouped_orders AS
SELECT 
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    SUM(o_totalprice) AS total_price
FROM 
    public.orders
GROUP BY 
    o_custkey, o_orderstatus
ORDER BY 
    o_custkey, o_orderstatus;
```

For optimization, create an index to speed up the grouping and sorting:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_grouping ON public.orders (o_custkey, o_orderstatus) INCLUDE (o_totalprice);
```

The index supports both the GROUP BY and ORDER BY operations while including the aggregated column.
