Of course. Here is the SQL query that can be pushed down to the Postgres data source, along with a suggested optimization.

SQL Query
This query combines the data selection from the Table input step and the filtering logic from the Filter rows step into a single operation. Pushing the WHERE clause down to the database is more efficient as it reduces the amount of data transferred over the network.

SQL

SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    o_totalprice,
    o_orderdate,
    o_orderpriority,
    o_clerk,
    o_shippriority,
    o_comment
FROM
    "public".orders
WHERE
    o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM';
Optimizations
To speed up the execution of this query, especially on a large orders table, you should create an index on the o_orderpriority column. This allows the database to quickly locate the rows matching the filter condition without having to perform a full table scan.

Here is the SQL command to create the index in Postgres:

SQL

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_orderpriority ON "public".orders (o_orderpriority);



////////// EXECUTED QUERY:

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_orderpriority ON "public".orders (o_orderpriority);

EXPLAIN 
SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    o_custkey,
    o_orderstatus,
    o_totalprice,
    o_orderdate,
    o_orderpriority,
    o_clerk,
    o_shippriority,
    o_comment
FROM
    "public".orders
WHERE
    o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM';


////////// EXECUTION PLAN:
