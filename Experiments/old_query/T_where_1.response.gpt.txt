To push down the ETL transformation to the PostgreSQL source, you should rewrite the SQL from the Table input step to include the filter condition from the Filter rows step.
✅ Final SQL Query (Pushed Down Filter)

SELECT
  o_orderkey,
  o_custkey,
  o_orderstatus,
  o_totalprice,
  o_orderdate,
  o_orderpriority,
  o_clerk,
  o_shippriority,
  o_comment
FROM public.orders
WHERE o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM       ';

This query includes the filtering condition directly in the SQL, eliminating the need to fetch all rows and then filter them in-memory, which is crucial for performance especially when dealing with large datasets.
🚀 Optimization Recommendations for PostgreSQL

To speed up execution further:
1. Indexing

Ensure an index exists on the o_orderpriority column:

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_orderpriority ON public.orders (o_orderpriority);

If this column is low cardinality (few distinct values), consider a partial index:

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_3_medium ON public.orders (o_orderpriority)
WHERE o_orderpriority = '3-MEDIUM       ';

This helps if only a small subset of rows match this value.
2. VACUUM & ANALYZE

Ensure table statistics are up-to-date:

VACUUM ANALYZE public.orders;

This improves query planning and index usage.
3. Trim Padding (Optional)

If o_orderpriority has fixed-length padding (as in '3-MEDIUM '), consider:

    Trimming it during query:

    WHERE TRIM(o_orderpriority) = '3-MEDIUM'

    Or better, redefine the column as VARCHAR without fixed length if possible, to avoid whitespace-related bugs.

🔁 Updated Kettle (PDI) Step Suggestion

To implement pushdown in Pentaho/Kettle:

    Modify the Table Input step SQL to include the WHERE clause as shown above.

    Remove the Filter Rows step, as filtering is now handled by SQL.

Let me know if you want me to regenerate the transformation XML with the optimized query embedded.
